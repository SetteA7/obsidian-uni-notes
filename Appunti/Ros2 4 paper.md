# 1) Setup
The setup involves:
- building the package
- starting zenoh bridge
- starting lidar

#### Building the Package
Package (saved in google drive) needs to be built with:
```
colcon build --symlink-install
```
This command must be run inside the workspace directory where the /src folder was extracted (from zip in google drive).

Finally add the source:
```
source install/setup.bash
```

To test if this worked out, run
```
ros2 interface show link_monitor_msg/msg/LinkMetrics
```
 It should return 
```
# Standard ROS 2 64-bit integer type
uint64
```
